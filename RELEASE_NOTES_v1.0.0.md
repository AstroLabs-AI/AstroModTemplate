# Release Notes - AstroExpansion v1.0.0

## The Final Frontier Update

This major release completes the space exploration experience with fully functional dimensions, gravity effects, and interdimensional travel!

### New Features

#### Space Dimension
- **The Void of Space**: A completely empty dimension at y=256
- **Zero Gravity**: Slow falling and levitation effects simulate weightlessness
- **Hostile Environment**: Requires space suit or suffer:
  - Suffocation damage (2 damage/second)
  - Wither, blindness, and slowness effects
- **Enhanced Solar Power**: Solar panels generate 2x power in space

#### Moon Dimension
- **Lunar Terrain**: Realistic moon surface with craters
  - Moon Stone base terrain
  - Moon Dust surface layer
  - Helium-3 Ore generates below y=40
- **Low Gravity**: 1/6th Earth gravity
  - Jump Boost III effect
  - Slow Falling I effect
- **Vacuum Environment**: Less hostile than space but still requires space suit

#### Dimensional Travel
- **Space Teleporter**: Travel to the Space dimension
  - Crafted with Quantum Core, Space Research Data, and Rocket parts
- **Moon Teleporter**: Travel to the Moon dimension
  - Crafted with Helium-3 Crystals, Lunar Rover, and Quantum components
- **Earth Teleporter**: Return home from space
  - Simple recipe using dirt, grass, and circuits
- **Safety Features**: Teleporters check for space suit before travel

#### Gravity System
- Automatic gravity effects based on dimension
- Space suit protection from environmental hazards
- Dimension-aware block behaviors

### Technical Improvements
- Custom chunk generators for each dimension
- Dimension type configurations with appropriate lighting
- Teleporter system with automatic platform generation
- Event-based gravity and environmental effects

### How to Use
1. Craft a full Space Suit (helmet, chestplate, leggings, boots)
2. Build a Space or Moon Teleporter
3. Right-click the teleporter to travel between dimensions
4. Teleporters create a safe arrival platform on first use
5. Use Earth Teleporter to return home

### Tips
- Always wear a full space suit when traveling to space or the moon
- Build your space station around the arrival platform
- Solar panels are twice as effective in space
- Mine Helium-3 on the moon for fusion fuel
- Life Support Systems are essential for space stations

### Coming Next
- Asteroid mining
- Space station modules
- Orbital mechanics
- Alien structures
