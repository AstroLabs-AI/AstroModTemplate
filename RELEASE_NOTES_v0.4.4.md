# AstroExpansion v0.4.4 Storage Core Access Fix

## 🔧 Storage System Improvements

This update fixes the chicken-and-egg problem where the Storage Core GUI wouldn't open without a formed network, but you couldn't insert drives to form the network without opening the GUI!

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Storage Core Always Accessible
- **Storage Core GUI now always opens** when right-clicked, regardless of network state
- You can now insert drives even when the network isn't formed
- Clear status messages explain what's needed to form the network

#### Helpful Status Messages
When right-clicking an unformed Storage Core, you'll see:
- **"Storage Core needs power!"** - If no energy is stored
- **"Insert storage drives to form network!"** - If powered but no drives
- **No message** - Network is formed and working properly

### 📝 Technical Details

The previous logic prevented GUI access when the network wasn't formed, which made it impossible to insert the drives needed to form the network. This has been fixed by:
1. Always allowing GUI access
2. Adding helpful status messages
3. Adding debug logging for troubleshooting (every 5 seconds if not formed)

### 🎮 What This Fixes
- Can now properly set up storage networks
- Clear feedback on what's preventing network formation
- No more confusion about "Storage network not formed!" error

### 📦 Installation
Drop the JAR file into your mods folder. This release includes all previous fixes.

### 📋 Storage Setup Checklist
1. ✅ Place Storage Core
2. ✅ Connect power (Energy Conduit from generator)
3. ✅ Right-click to open GUI (now always works!)
4. ✅ Insert at least one Storage Drive
5. ✅ Network forms automatically within 1 second
