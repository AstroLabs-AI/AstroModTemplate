# Astro Expansion v0.3.0-beta Release Notes

## 🚀 Phase 3 Beta: Advanced Multiblocks & Fusion Power!

This beta release brings the powerful Fusion Reactor to Astro Expansion, marking a significant milestone in our journey to space!

### ✨ New Features

#### Fusion Reactor (NEW!)
- **3x3x3 Multiblock Structure**: Build with Fusion Reactor Casing blocks and glass windows
- **Massive Power Generation**: Produces 50,000 FE/tick when operating
- **Fusion Fuel System**: Requires Deuterium and Tritium gases
- **Temperature Management**: Must reach 8,000K to initiate fusion
- **10M FE Storage**: Internal energy buffer for power distribution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: GUI shows temperature, fuel levels, and energy status

#### New Items & Blocks
- Fusion Reactor Controller
- Fusion Reactor Casing
- Fusion Core
- Plasma Injector
- Advanced Processor
- Titanium Plate

### 🔧 Improvements from Alpha
- Enhanced multiblock validation system
- Better fluid handling for fusion fuels
- Improved GUI rendering for multiblock machines
- Optimized energy distribution

### 📊 Technical Details
- Fusion Reactor consumes 10 mB/tick each of Deuterium and Tritium
- Temperature increases by 100K/tick when fueled
- Automatic shutdown when fuel depleted or energy buffer full
- Compatible with all FE-based energy systems

### 🎮 Getting Started with Fusion Power
1. Craft a Fusion Reactor Controller and 26 Fusion Reactor Casings
2. Build the 3x3x3 structure (controller in center of middle layer)
3. Replace corner blocks with glass for visual effect
4. Supply Deuterium and Tritium via fluid pipes
5. Wait for reactor to heat up to operating temperature
6. Enjoy massive power generation!

### 🐛 Known Issues
- Fusion Reactor GUI texture is placeholder
- Fluid rendering in tanks may flicker
- Multiblock structures don't persist rotation on world reload

### 📝 Full Changelog
- Added Fusion Reactor multiblock structure
- Added fusion fuel system with Deuterium and Tritium
- Added temperature-based fusion reaction mechanics
- Added Advanced Processor and Titanium Plate items
- Added crafting recipes for all fusion components
- Fixed fluid pipe connection logic
- Improved multiblock pattern matching performance

### 🔜 Coming Next
- Quantum Computer for research system
- More multiblock structures (Rocket Assembly, Launch Pad)
- Wireless energy/item/fluid transport
- Space preparation machines
