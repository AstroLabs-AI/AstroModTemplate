# Astro Expansion v0.3.3-beta Hotfix

## ðŸ”§ GUI Fix - All Machine Interfaces Now Working

This hotfix addresses the issue where machine GUIs would not open when right-clicked.

### Fixed
- **Missing GUI Screens**: Created GUI screens for all Phase 1 machines
  - Basic Generator GUI with fuel slot and energy display
  - Material Processor GUI with progress arrow and energy bar
  - Ore Washer GUI with water tank and energy display
  - Energy Storage GUI with large centered energy display
- **Screen Registration**: Added all missing screens to ClientEvents registration
- **Ore Washer Fluid Support**: Added missing fluid tank to Ore Washer block entity
- **Menu Data Synchronization**: Fixed data slot counts and accessors

### Verification
- All machines now open their GUIs when right-clicked
- Energy levels, progress bars, and fluid tanks display correctly
- Inventory slots work properly in all machine interfaces

### Known Issues (from previous releases)
- GUI textures are placeholders (will show purple/black texture)
- Many block/item textures are missing (purple/black placeholders)
- Fluid rendering in tanks may flicker
- Multiblock structures don't persist rotation on world reload

### Testing Instructions
1. Place any machine (Basic Generator, Material Processor, Ore Washer, Energy Storage)
2. Right-click to open GUI
3. GUIs should now open properly (though textures will be missing)
