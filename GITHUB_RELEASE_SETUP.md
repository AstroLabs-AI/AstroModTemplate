# GitHub Release Setup Guide

## üöÄ Automated Build & Release System

This repository is now configured with GitHub Actions for automated building and releasing of Astro Expansion.

## üìã Setup Complete

### 1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**

#### Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- Triggers on: Push to main branches, Pull requests
- Actions:
  - Sets up Java 17
  - Builds the mod with Gradle
  - Uploads build artifacts
  - Uploads build reports on failure

#### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Triggers on: Git tags starting with 'v' (e.g., v1.0.0)
- Also supports manual trigger with version input
- Actions:
  - Builds the mod with the tagged version
  - Creates a GitHub Release
  - Attaches the built JAR file
  - Generates release notes automatically
  - Placeholders for CurseForge/Modrinth upload

#### Publish Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
- Triggers on: GitHub release published
- Ready for CurseForge and Modrinth integration
- Currently contains commented placeholders

### 2. **Additional Setup Files**

- **README.md**: Project description with badges
- **LICENSE**: MIT License
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**: Contribution guidelines
- **.github/dependabot.yml**: Automated dependency updates
- **release.sh**: Manual release helper script

## üîß How to Use

### Automatic Release (Recommended)

1. **Update version** in `gradle.properties`:
   ```properties
   mod_version=1.0.1
   ```

2. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your changes"
   ```

3. **Create and push a tag**:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.1
   git push origin forge-1.20.1
   git push origin v1.0.1
   ```

4. **GitHub Actions will automatically**:
   - Build the mod
   - Create a release named "Astro Expansion v1.0.1"
   - Attach the JAR file as `astroexpansion-1.0.1-mc1.20.1.jar`
   - Generate release notes

### Manual Release

Use the provided script:
```bash
./release.sh
```

This will:
- Prompt for new version
- Update gradle.properties
- Build the mod
- Create release files
- Provide instructions for git commands

## üîë Required Secrets (Future)

To enable full platform publishing, add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. **CurseForge**: `CURSEFORGE_API_TOKEN`
2. **Modrinth**: `MODRINTH_TOKEN`

Get these from:
- CurseForge: https://authors.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens
- Modrinth: https://modrinth.com/settings/pats
