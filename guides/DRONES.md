## üìä Drone Management

### Power Consumption
| Drone Type | Idle | Working | Per Operation |
|------------|------|---------|---------------|
| Mining | 5 FE/t | 20 FE/t | 100 FE/block |
| Construction | 5 FE/t | 15 FE/t | 50 FE/block |
| Farming | 3 FE/t | 10 FE/t | 20 FE/action |
| Combat | 5 FE/t | 25 FE/t | 200 FE/kill |
| Logistics | 3 FE/t | 10 FE/t | 50 FE/trip |

### Efficiency Tips
1. **Multiple Docks**: Use several drones for large operations
2. **Specialized Roles**: Each drone type for its purpose
3. **Power Planning**: Ensure adequate charging capacity
4. **Range Optimization**: Place docks centrally
5. **Maintenance**: Drones auto-repair at dock
