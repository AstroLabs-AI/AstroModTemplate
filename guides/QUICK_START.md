# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to AstroExpansion! This guide will get you started with the basics in your first hour of play.

## üéØ First Steps (0-15 minutes)

### 1. Gather Basic Resources
Just like vanilla Minecraft, you'll need:
- Wood for tools and crafting
- Cobblestone for your first machines
- Coal for fuel and torches
- Iron (at least 30 ingots to start)

### 2. Find New Ores
While mining, look for:
- **Titanium Ore** - Light gray, found at Y 5-45
- **Lithium Ore** - Light blue, found at Y 20-60
- **Uranium Ore** - Green glow, found at Y 5-20 (careful!)

**Tip**: Don't smelt these ores yet! Processing doubles output.

### 3. Craft Essential Items
```
Circuit Board = [Redstone] [Green Dye] [Iron Ingot]
Energy Core = [Redstone Block] [Gold Ingot] [Iron Block]
Processor = [Circuit Board] [Gold Ingot] [Redstone]
```

## ‚ö° Power Generation (15-30 minutes)

### 1. Build Your First Generator

**Basic Generator Recipe:**
```
[I] [F] [I]
[I] [R] [I]
[C] [C] [C]

I = Iron Ingot
F = Furnace
R = Redstone Block
C = Cobblestone
```

### 2. Set Up Power Storage

**Energy Storage Recipe:**
```
[I] [R] [I]
[R] [E] [R]
[I] [R] [I]

I = Iron Ingot
R = Redstone
E = Energy Core
```

### 3. Connect with Conduits
```
Energy Conduit = [Iron] [Redstone] [Iron] (makes 8)
```

**Basic Setup:**
```
[Generator] ‚Üí [Energy Storage] ‚Üí [Your First Machine]
```

## üè≠ First Machine (30-45 minutes)

### Build a Material Processor

**Recipe:**
```
[I] [P] [I]
[R] [F] [R]
[I] [C] [I]

I = Iron Ingot, P = Piston
R = Redstone, F = Furnace
C = Circuit Board
```

### Why It's Important
- Doubles all ore output
- 1 Raw Titanium ‚Üí 2 Titanium Dust ‚Üí 2 Titanium Ingots
- Works with vanilla ores too!

### How to Use
1. Place next to your power setup
2. Connect with Energy Conduit
3. Put raw ores in top slot
4. Collect dust from bottom slot
5. Smelt dust in furnace for ingots

## üì¶ Basic Automation (45-60 minutes)

### Simple Hopper Setup
```
[Chest] (Input)
   ‚Üì
[Hopper]
   ‚Üì
[Material Processor]
   ‚Üì
[Hopper]
   ‚Üì
[Furnace]
   ‚Üì
[Chest] (Output)
```

### Power Check
- Generator with coal: 40 FE/tick
- Material Processor: 20 FE/tick when running
- Energy Storage: 100,000 FE buffer
- **Result**: Can run continuously!

## üéÆ What's Next?

### Immediate Goals
1. **Process all your ores** - Never smelt raw ores directly
2. **Expand power** - Build 2-3 generators
3. **Add Ore Washer** - 10% bonus materials
4. **Start storage system** - Digital item storage

### Resource Targets
Aim to collect:
- 64+ Iron Ingots
- 32+ Titanium Ingots
- 16+ Gold Ingots
- 8+ Diamonds
- Stack of Redstone

### Next Machines Priority
1. **Ore Washer** - Bonus materials from ores
2. **Component Assembler** - Advanced crafting
3. **Storage Core** - Digital storage system
4. **Mining Drone** - Automated mining

## üí° Pro Tips for Beginners

### DO:
‚úÖ Process ores before smelting (2x output)
‚úÖ Build Energy Storage early (power buffer)
‚úÖ Keep fuel stocked in generators
‚úÖ Plan machine placement for expansion
‚úÖ Read machine GUIs for power/progress

### DON'T:
‚ùå Smelt raw ores directly (wastes half)
‚ùå Build too many machines without power
‚ùå Forget to connect conduits
‚ùå Ignore the new ores
‚ùå Rush advanced tech without basics

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "My machine isn't working!"
1. Check power connection (conduits touching?)
2. Verify generator has fuel
3. Ensure machine has materials
4. Look for full output slots

### "I can't find new ores!"
- Titanium: Y 5-45 (iron level)
- Lithium: Y 20-60 (higher up)
- Uranium: Y 5-20 (diamond level)
- Try branch mining at Y=12

### "I'm out of power!"
- Add more generators
- Check Energy Storage level
- Turn off unused machines
- Use coal blocks (9x burn time)
