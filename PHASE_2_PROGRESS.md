- **New Items**: 16 (4 drives, housing, storage processor, 5 drone items, circuit board, processor, energy core, drone core)
- **New Entities**: 5 (All drone types)
- **New GUIs**: 4 (Storage Core, Storage Terminal, Component Assembler, Drone Dock)
- **New Recipes**: 20+ (all items craftable)
- **Lines of Code**: ~4,000 added

## ðŸŽ® Testing Phase 2

### Creative Mode Commands
```minecraft
# Storage system components
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_core
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_terminal
/give @p astroexpansion:storage_drive_1k
/give @p astroexpansion:energy_conduit 16

# Connect to power
/give @p astroexpansion:basic_generator
/give @p minecraft:coal 64
```

### Setup Instructions
1. Place Storage Core
2. Connect to power with Energy Conduits
3. Insert Storage Drives into Core
4. Place Storage Terminal nearby (within 16 blocks)
5. Access Terminal to use storage network

## âœ… All Phase 2 Goals Achieved!

### What Was Completed
- âœ… Full digital storage system with network capabilities
- âœ… Import/Export automation buses
- âœ… Component Assembler for advanced crafting
- âœ… Complete drone system with 5 specialized types
- âœ… Drone Dock for charging and management
- âœ… All GUIs fully implemented
- âœ… All recipes and crafting chains
- âœ… Entity rendering and animations
- âœ… Energy integration throughout

### Ready for Phase 3
The mod now has a complete storage and automation system ready for space-age expansion!

## ðŸ’¡ Design Decisions

### Storage Network
- Chose proximity-based connection for simplicity
- Energy cost scales with drive count
- Terminal requires active network to open
- Drives are hot-swappable

### Technical Choices
- Used HashMap for item storage (fast lookups)
- Lazy network validation (check on access)
- Capability system for cross-mod compatibility
- Separate API package for extensions

## ðŸŽ¯ Phase 2 Completion: 100% âœ…

All Phase 2 features have been successfully implemented! The mod now includes a complete digital storage network, automated item transfer, advanced component crafting, and a full drone automation system with 5 specialized drone types. Ready to proceed to Phase 3!
